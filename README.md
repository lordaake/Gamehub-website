## Description
Gamehub is the first website I have ever created, it was a part of a school project at Noroff school.
Gamehub is a web project that replicates a Figma prototype, with a focus on aesthetics and responsive design. The development process involved learning by experimentation, leading to improved HTML and CSS skills. The project prioritizes creating a visually pleasing and responsive website, ensuring it functions well on a variety of devices.

"A website for gamers to discover new games and connect with the gaming community.
Gamehub is the shop for all the best Playbox games available on the market right now."
