Introduction: 

In this report, I'll talk about how the GameHub website was made, the problems that came up along the way, and what I've learned from this project. 


Building the Website: 

The aim was to make the website as similar to the Figma prototype as possible. While I was able to create the website to look like the prototype, there were some differences in the width and height of the objects. I was not able to make the colors look exactly the same as Figma behaves differently. Additionally, I was not able to create the carousel exactly the same. To mitigate these differences, I adjusted the height and width of the objects to create an aesthetically pleasing website.


CSS Code:

All of my coding is in HTML and CSS, and I used VS Code.

Initially, I was not aware that all the CSS code should be placed in just one file. As a result, I made one CSS file for each HTML page I created, along with a header-footer-body CSS file. However, I later learned that all the CSS code should be placed in one file. When I tried to place all the code in one file, I faced some issues. In the end, I decided to keep all my CSS code in separate files and link each HTML page to its own CSS file. I might fix this later, but at the moment there is a lack of time.


Learning Experience: 

The process of building this website was an incredible learning experience for me. I spent the majority of my time attempting to figure things out on my own, relying on the internet for assistance rather than tutorials. I discovered that tutorials are generally helpful for learning the fundamentals, but it's preferable to try things out and experiment in order to properly understand how to create HTML and CSS. I was able to gain a much better understanding of HTML and CSS, and I gained some confidence in my ability to create websites from scratch.


Responsive Design: 

In this project, I also learned about responsive design. I learned that it is important to make sure that a website is responsive so that it can be easily viewed on different devices, such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. I focused on making it responsive from the beginning. I initially struggled, but as I worked, I picked up the various working techniques. The clamp tool, %, vw, vh, calc, media query, and others


I faced several issues while making a responsive webpage. One of the major issues was ensuring consistency in the layout across different devices and screen sizes. This was challenging as I had to make sure that all the elements were properly aligned and spaced apart, regardless of the device being used.

Another issue was making sure that the text and images were easily readable on small screens. I had to use media queries and change the font size and spacing to make this happen. 

Additionally, I faced some difficulties in managing the viewport size of the website. It was important to make sure that the viewport was set correctly; otherwise, it could lead to a distorted layout on smaller screens.

Finally, I faced some challenges with the navigation menu. I had to make the burger-menu for the tablet and mobile sized webpage. This took some time as I wasnt sure how to do it. 


Conclusion: 

Overall, building the GameHub website was a challenging but rewarding experience. I learned a lot about web development and responsive design, and I am confident that these skills will be useful for me in my future projects. Despite the challenges, I am proud of what I have accomplished and look forward to continuing to improve my skills in web development.

Making sure the website was responsive and could be seen correctly on different devices was a hard but important task that required me to learn a lot about web development and design.
